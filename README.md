# HLF-Performance-Predictor
- Built AI model to predict blockchain network performance without running expensive real-world tests
- Engineered DNN-based model predicting blockchain network throughput and latency from topology/workload parameters,attaining 10-15% MAPE across 15,000 benchmarks and sub500ms inference.
- Automated ML pipeline orchestrating Hyperledger Caliper across 9 topologies with 11 configuration features, eliminating costly real-time benchmarking. Explored transfer learning to adapt models to unseen topologies, uncovering performance trade-offs between peer counts, orderer overhead, and block size optimization
